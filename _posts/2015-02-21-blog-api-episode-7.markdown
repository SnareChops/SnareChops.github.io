As you are probably asking yourself, why is this episode 7 when the last one was episode 3? ... well, 4, 5, and 6 didn't go so well. I have sat on these videos for days trying to figure out the best way to put them out that give you the best content and what I decided was that I would release them all at once, and just present the latest one as the main one.

So leaving off in episode 3 we were done with the front end deployment, and were going to continue with the back end deployment. The process was rough, and I ended up with 2.5 hours of video of me frustrated and trying to figure out an issue with the process that I just couldn't seem to get right. So in an effor to spare you from all of that I decided to skip on ahead.

That being said... There is still some value in the deployment videos, like the first one (episode 4) where I show the setup of using Docker and shell scripts to automate the process and isolate our application. If you are interested in this, please check out the links below the video. There is still useful information in them, but I feel that being encountered by these videos over an extended period of time may cause some to lose interest in the series.

Enough of me babbling, hope you enjoy!
