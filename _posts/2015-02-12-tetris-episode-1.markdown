**NEW SERIES**

Today I am starting a new series of videos that will cover the development of an application from scratch all the way from the beginning to the end. No cuts, no edits, you see everything.

I wanted to do this video to show how code is written for a project like this, how it is grown over time, how debugging is a constant process, and how you are not alone in making mistakes

I hope you like this series and I am hoping to have frequent episodes.
